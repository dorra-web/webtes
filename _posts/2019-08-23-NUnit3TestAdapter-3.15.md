NUnit3TestAdapter version 3.15.0 is released.

This release is a major performance improvement release. When used from Visual Studio, and used with a selection of tests, it will significantly speed up the discovery of those. Note that discovery is also a part of the execution, so you will also see the performance improvement for execution. It will be mostly noticable when you have a large set of tests.
